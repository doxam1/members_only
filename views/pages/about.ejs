                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>At <strong>Who Said That?!</strong>, we believe everyone should have a platform to share their
                        thoughts, ideas, and experiences — without fear of judgment, surveillance, or personal exposure.
                        While we require accounts to ensure a meaningful, secure environment, we are committed to
                        keeping your identity private and your data safe.</p>

                    <h2>How It Works</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Account Creation:</strong> Users need to create an account to participate. However,
                            we do not collect or require sensitive personal information. You can use a pseudonym if you
                            wish, and your identity remains fully protected.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We do not track your activities on the site. Once your account
                            is created, we won’t follow you around with ads or other tracking systems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Privacy Focused:</strong> Your account is safe with us. We respect your anonymity
                            and aim to keep your personal details private. We only ask for what is necessary to operate
                            the board and provide a space for free expression.</li>
                        <li><strong>Secure and Safe:</strong> Your password and other sensitive data are encrypted, and
                            we take steps to ensure that your account is protected from unauthorized access.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                    <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Honest, Unfiltered Conversations:</strong> We believe in open dialogue, free from
                            the fear of judgment. Share your thoughts, ideas, or questions on any topic you wish — your
                            words are what matter here, not your personal details.</li>
                        <li><strong>Community-Driven:</strong> <strong>Who Said That?!</strong> is a place for anyone
                            who wishes to share. Your voice matters, whether you are new or have been here for a while.
                            The message board thrives on participation from people just like you.</li>

                    <h2>Why Anonymity Matters</h2>
                    <p>Anonymity is not just about hiding your identity — it's about the freedom to express yourself
                        without the constraints of reputation or fear of exposure. On <strong>Who Said That?!</strong>,
                        you can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Post Freely:</strong> Feel free to discuss any topic without worrying about your
                            real-world identity being attached to your words.</li>
                        <li><strong>Protect Your Privacy:</strong> Your personal details are never exposed to other
                            users. You remain in control of what you share, and your account can be as anonymous as you
                            want it to be.</li>
                        <li><strong>Share without Judgment:</strong> Here, the focus is on what you say, not who you
                            are. Everyone’s voice is valued equally, and your posts stand on their own merit.</li>
                    </ul>
